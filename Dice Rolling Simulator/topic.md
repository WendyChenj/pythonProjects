The Goal: Like the title suggests, this project involves writing a program that simulates rolling dice. 
When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6. 
(Or whatever other integer you prefer — the number of sides on the die is up to you.) 
The program will print what that number is. 
It should then ask you if you’d like to roll again.
For this project, you’ll need to set the min and max number that your dice can produce.
